# Multi_Arm_Bandits

This notebook contains an overview of multi-arm bandits in the stochastic setup, we also discuss at the end the combination between bandits and game theory.

We expose the main algorithms in the complete visibility and without visibility and show the upper bound of the regret.

In this notebook the reader will find an implementation of UCB algorithm, ETC algorithm, a greedy algorithm in the complete visibilty setup.
